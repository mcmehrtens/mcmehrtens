# Matthew Mehrtens

## About Me

Hi, I'm currently a senior in aerospace engineering at Iowa Sstate University with a minor in computer science. I'm big into music and technology, but I also frequently read books about politics, philosophy, and history.

### Professional

I've worked at Collins Aerospace for several years on the [Air Launched Effects](https://www.army.mil/article/238407/air_launched_effects_ale) program as a systems/software engineering intern.

### Education

I'm nearing the end of my undergraduate education at Iowa State. I've completed all the requirements for computer science minor and for graduating with honors. Following my graduation in May 2024, I intend to pursue a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering with [Dr. Runnels and the Solids Group](https://www.solids.group) at Iowa State University.

## What I'm Working On

Like most of us, I've always got a couple of projects kicking around. Currently, I've been engaged in building out my [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/). It's provided interesting opportunities to learn about DevSecOps, code infrastructure, server hardware and technologies, containerization, documentation, and much more.
