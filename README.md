## About Me
Hi! I'm a 21 yo male, currently enrolled as a junior in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I'm big into music and technology, but I also frequently read books politics, philosophy (or both!), and history. My lovely fianc√©e is a Chemical Engineer at Iowa State University, and we've both lived in Iowa for most of our lives.

### Professional
Last summer and fall (2022), I worked as a co-op (intern) for Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, IA as a Systems Engineering Intern. I'm currently (early 2023) working for the same team part-time remotely and will return to that team in-person this summer (2023).

### Education
This semester, I will complete all the requirements for my COM S minor and for graduating with honors. After the fall 2023 semester, I'll start a concurrent graduate degree program where I'll begin working on my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering while finishing up the last few classes of my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. My expected undergraduate graduation is December 2024, and my expected graduate graduation is May 2025.

## What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm working on a number of HomeLab projects. I recently built a NAS and with the extra headroom (of which there is plenty), I've had the opportunity to experiment with a number of different open source softwares.
